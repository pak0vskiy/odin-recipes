        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p style="margin: 1em 1em;">
        <i>Kimchi stew</i> is one of the <strong>most-loved</strong> of all the stews in Korean cuisine. 
        It is a warm, hearty, spicy, savory, delicious dish that pretty much everyone loves. 
        As long as they can handle spicy food, I never met a person who didn’t like kimchi-jjigae.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 1em 1em;">
        Kimchi stew is thicker than kimchi soup. Kimchi soup is less salty than kimchi stew. 
        Also, soup is always served in individual bowls, with rice. 
        Traditionally in Korean cuisine stews were served in a big pot on the table, and the family would eat communally from the pot. 
        These days, some people (including me) get a little freaked out by double-dipping, 
        so for stews I put individual bowls on the table, and a large spoon so that diners can take 
        what they like from the pot and put it in their bowls.
